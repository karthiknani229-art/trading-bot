The log file contains:

Order request details

Binance API responses

Error traces

 Includes evidence of:

one MARKET order

one LIMIT order

(as required by the assignment)

 Validation & Error Handling

The application validates:

symbol presence

side (BUY/SELL)

order type (MARKET/LIMIT)

quantity > 0

price required for LIMIT

Handled failures include:

invalid CLI input

Binance API errors

timestamp drift

network issues

 Assumptions

Orders are placed on Binance USDT-M Futures Testnet

Minimum notional requirements are enforced by Binance

LIMIT orders may remain in NEW status if price is not reached

MARKET orders on testnet may briefly show NEW before fill
